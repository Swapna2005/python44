    <p> HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author â€”
these are the tags. The text is then saved as a html file, and viewed through
a browser, like Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. This browser reads the file
and translates the text into a visible form, hopefully rendering the page as the
author had intended. Writing your own HTML entails using tags correctly to create
your vision. You can use anything from a rudimentary text-editor to a powerful
graphical editor to create HTML pages</p>
